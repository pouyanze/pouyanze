Hi, I'm Nova! ðŸ‘‹

I recently graduated from SAIT after studying Applied Product Management, a program offered in collaboration with @TacitEdge. Currently, I am working as the Technical Program Manager at Immigrant Techies in Calgary! 

In 2023, I had the opportunity to serve as the product manager for two apprenticeship projects. Both projects utilized AI to enhance the core functionality of the applications in unique ways.

A bit about my background:

Previously, I ran a product-based business, specializing in crafting furniture and custom wood projects. Additionally, I managed product sales in a showroom setting.

I have a background in web development, civil engineering, with experience in project coordination and project management.

Looking forward to connecting with you further!
