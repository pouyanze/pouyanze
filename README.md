Hi, I'm Nova! ðŸ‘‹
Right now I am an Applied Product Management student at SAIT, a program offered in cooperation with @TacitEdge.
I have been a product manager for two startups recently, both of them leveraging AI to empower the community in their own unique way. A bit of history of mine:
Coming from:
1- Running a product-based business in Iran, focusing on making furniture and custom wood projects and also selling products in a showroom
2- Civil engineering, project coordination, and project management

I genuinely enjoy preventing and solving problems and achieving results.

3- Programming bootcamp
